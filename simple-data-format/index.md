This document defines a simple data publishing format (Simple Data
Format) for publishing and sharing tabular-style data.

The format's focus is on simplicity and ease of use over the web -- that
is, usage online with access and transmission *over HTTP*. In addition
the format is focused on data that can be presented in a tabular
structure and in making it easy to produce (and consume) this format
from spreadsheets and relational databases.

The key features of this format are the following:

-   CSV (comma separated variables) for data
-   Single JSON file (datapackage.json) to describe the dataset
    including a schema for data files
-   Reuse wherever possible of existing work including other Data
    Protocols specifications

## Quick Start

A Simple Data Format package contains:

-   Data files in CSV
-   (Minimal) dataset information in JSON (including a schema for the
    CSV)

Here's an example of a minimal simple data format dataset:

    2 files

    data.csv
    datapackage.json


    data.csv
    --------

    var1,var2,var3
    A,1,2
    B,3,4

    datapackage.json
    ----------------

    {
      "name": "my-dataset",
      # here we list the data files in this dataset
      "resources": [
        {
          "path": "data.csv",
          "schema": {
            "fields": [
              {
                "name": "var1",
                "type": "string"
              },
              {
                "name": "var2",
                "type": "integer"
              },
              {
                "name": "var3",
                "type": "number"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }

## Specification

This specification builds on the 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data-packages/">Data Packages specification</a>. It defines a profile for publishing data packages that places some additional constraints on metadata and data formats.

A valid Simple Data Format package MUST be a valid Data Package as defined in that specification. This means that it MUST:

-  Contain a package descriptor (`datapackage.json`)
-  Provide at least the minimum required package metadata as described in the Data Package specification
-  Include a description of each data file in the package in the `resources` array of the package

In addition to those basic rules, a valid Simple Data Format package MUST conform to the following additional 
requirements:

-   It MUST contain at least one *data file*
-   All data files MUST be in CSV format, see below for additional rules on CSV file naming and structure
-   Every resource MUST have a `schema` following the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/json-table-schema/">JSON Table Schema</a> specification

CSV Files
---------

As a starting point, CSV files included in a Simple Data Format package must conform to the RFC for CSV (4180 - Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files). In addition:

-   File names MUST end with `.csv`
-   Files MUST be encoded as UTF-8
-   Files MUST have a single header row. This row MUST be the first row in the
    file.

    -   Terminology: each column in the CSV file is termed a *field* and
        its `name` is the string in that column in the header row.
    -   The `name` MUST be unique amongst fields and MUST contain at
        least one character
    -   There are no further restrictions on the form of the `name` but
        it is RECOMMENDED that it contain only alphanumeric characters
        together with " .-\_"
-   Rows in the file MUST NOT contain more fields than are in the header row (though they may
    contain less)
-   Each file MUST have an entry in the `resources` array in the `datapackage.json` file
-   The resource metadata MUST include a `schema` attribute whose value MUST conform to the JSON
    Table Schema
-   All fields in the CSV files MUST be described in the `schema`

CSV files generated by different applications often vary in their syntax, e.g.
use of quoting characters, delimiters, etc. To encourage conformance, CSV files
in a Simple Data Format SHOULD

-   Use "," as field delimiters
-   Use "\\r\\n" or "\\n" as line terminators

If a CSV file does not follow these rules then its specific CSV dialect MUST be documented. The resource 
hash for the resource in the `datapackage.json` descriptor MUST:

-   Include a `dialect` key that conforms to that described in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/csv-dialect/">CSV Dialect Description Format</a>

Applications processing the CSV file SHOULD use the `dialect` of the CSV file to guide parsing.

## Key Design Features and Principles

The format's focus is on simplicity and web usage -- that is, usage
online with access and transmission *over HTTP*. In addition the format
is focused on data that can be presented in a tabular structure and in
making it easy to produce (and consume) this format from spreadsheets
and relational databases.

The key features of this format are the following:

-   CSV (comma separated variables) as the base data format
-   JSON as the base format for schema definition
-   Reuse wherever possible of existing work including other Data
    Protocols specifications

Why CSV
-------

1.  CSV is very simple - it is perhaps *the* most simple data format
2.  CSV is tabular-oriented. Most data structures are either tabular or
    can be transformed to a tabular structure by some form of
    normalization
3.  It is open and the "standard" is well-known
4.  It is widely supported - practically every spreadsheet program,
    relational database and programming language in existence can handle
    CSV in some form or other
5.  It is text-based and therefore amenable to manipulation and access
    from a wide range of standard tools (including revision control
    systems such as git, mercurial and subversion)
6.  It is line-oriented which means it can be incrementally processed --
    you do not need to read an entire file to extract a single row. For
    similar reasons it means that the format supports streaming.

More informally:

> CSV is the data Kalashnikov: not pretty, but many wars have been
fought with it and kids can use it.

Lindenberg)]

> CSV is the ultimate simple, standard data format - streamable,
text-based, no need for proprietary tools etc [@rufuspollock (Rufus
Pollock)]

Why JSON
--------

-   JSON is simple
-   JSON supports rich structure including nesting and basic types
-   JSON is very widely used and supported (all major programming
    languages can handle JSON)
-   JSON is web-native (every browser can access and manipulate JSON)
-   JSON is readable as simple text making it amenable to management and
    processing using simple text tools

## Open Issues

-   Foreign keys between files
-   Primary keys and uniqueness

## Alternatives Discussion

What alternatives are there for the data portion of the Simple Data
format?

-   Use line oriented JSON (?)

    -   Greater flexibility and complexity on types and objects
    -   No support from spreadsheets

-   Use SQLite

    -   (+) compact, full DB in one
    -   (-) lack of support (e.g. from spreadsheets), no streaming, not
        accessible with text tools etc

NOTE: this specification owes a great deal to the excellent Dataset
Publishing Language (DSPL) put forward by Google. The main
difference is in using JSON instead of XML for the schema and
re-using as far as possible the JSON-LD schema language (based on
linked-data) rather than inventing a new type and schema
structure.

### Alternative CSV format

This describes a possible alternative CSV-based format for serializing
the metadata. It has the advantage that you could then put a single
dataset in one spreadsheet (using multiple sheets).

In this format each key in the JSON file becomes a column. In addition
there is one initial column named @key@. Values for this column are then
attribute names. To illustrate (spacing for illustrative purposes only):

    @key@, year, series, ...
    @type, ...,  xsd:string
    simpletype, date, string
    label, ....
    ...
