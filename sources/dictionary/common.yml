  title: Profile
  description: The profile of this descriptor.
  context: Every Package and Resource descriptor has a profile. The default profile,
    if none is declared, is `default`. The namespace for the profile is the type
    of descriptor, so, `default` for a Package descriptor is not the same as `default`
    for a Resource descriptor.
  type: string
  default: default
  examples:
  - |
      {
        "profile": "tabular-data-package"
      }
  - |
      {
        "profile": "http://example.com/my-profiles-json-schema.json"
      }
name:
  title: Name
  description: An identifier string. Lower case characters with `.`, `_`, `-` and `/` are allowed.
  type: string
  pattern: "^([-a-z0-9._/])+$"
  context: This is ideally a url-usable and human-readable name. Name `SHOULD` be
    invariant, meaning it `SHOULD NOT` change when its parent descriptor is updated.
  examples:
  - |
      {
        "name": "my-nice-name"
      }
id:
  title: ID
  description: A property reserved for globally unique identifiers. Examples of
    identifiers that are unique include UUIDs and DOIs.
  context: A common usage pattern for Data Packages is as a packaging format within
    the bounds of a system or platform. In these cases, a unique identifier for
    a package is desired for common data handling workflows, such as updating an
    existing package. While at the level of the specification, global uniqueness
    cannot be validated, consumers using the `id` property `MUST` ensure identifiers
    are globally unique.
  type: string

      {
